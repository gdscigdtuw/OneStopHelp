# OneStopHelp :handshake:

This Project is a web app that is committed to providing current students with the necessary information and all the resources to succeed in college. 

# Vision  :sparkles:
`OneStopHelp` primarily focuses on students lacking resources to study for their exams. The problem lies in which material is valuable and which isn’t. Students don’t have time to surf the net in the hope of stumbling upon valuable websites for studying. So this web app provides students all the resources needed by them including notes, books, previous year exam papers and more.

# Objective :zap:
This website will help students by providing all the resources and help to succeed in college.
